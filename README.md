Project Description
From my daily life, I have been tired of doing glocery every week and then cleaning up dried spanish, stink chicken wings and clustered milk box from my refrigerator. No need to mention an extremely ancient steak that has been forgotten in the most deep layer of the frozen section.
I indeed hope there can be a "SMART" refrigerator which can keep track of all the things I put into it, remind me of the status of my vegetables and even more.
After I have done some market research the newly smart refrigerator, which has a touch screen on it and also a carmera just on the top the refrigerator gate. It can automatically capture the imagine of the things you put into your refrigerator (at least it can recognize an apple). It is pretty new (just released early this year), but not surprisingly expensive (~$4000, I mean it is not affordable for me but it has some market space at least). 

Here is a  few videos I found showing you this product

After I watched these videos, I am be like "Damn, this is the type of product I am looking for". However, there should be a lot of people like me either can not afford such luxury refrigerator or do not live in their own properties. I think there should be a simpler solution if my demand is only about having some hardware and software to help me keeping track of things I put into the refrigerator.

1) Objective of the project
   A deployable, moveable solution to the problem above (For example, a small, independently sold without a fancy refrigerator, carmera which can be attached on any device, and a software program (APP?) as the interface with the carmera)
2) Achieveble?
   I am not very sure about this. Firstly, I do not have any software development experience. As I can see now, I will need some hardware (carmera?) as the source of imagine capturing and imagine classification software?
3) Source of data?
   I will create data by myself
4) Main computation?
   I believe imagine classification has been a mature field. With the help of AI, I don't think there will be a lot of computation I need to do by myself. 
5) Features
   Discussed above
6) Am I Excited?
    Yes, Let'e beat Samsung with a cheaper solution. (Actually, I am quite sad when I see some product exactly match my requirement and expectation on this project. I mean if there is already such a product, what is the meaning of put my effort into this project?
